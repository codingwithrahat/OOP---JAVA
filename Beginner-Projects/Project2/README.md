# Mini Project: Car Information and Classic Car Checker

This mini project is a simple **Car Information System** that takes input for two cars, including their model, year, and mileage. The program then evaluates whether each car is considered a classic car based on its age.

## Features:
- Input car details (model, year, and mileage).
- Display car information.
- Evaluate whether the car is considered a classic based on its age.

## Check Result:
The `isClassicCar()` method returns:
- **"YES"** if the car is 25 years old or older.
- **"NO"** if the car is younger than 25 years.

## Concepts Demonstrated:
- Basic Object-Oriented Concepts (Classes, Constructors, Methods)
- Using the `Scanner` class for user input
- Conditional statements (if-else)

## How It Works:
The program prompts the user to enter the details of two cars, and based on the provided year, it evaluates whether the car is a classic or not.
