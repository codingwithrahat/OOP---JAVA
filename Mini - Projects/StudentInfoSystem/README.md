# Mini Project: Student Information System

This mini project is a simple **Student Information System** that takes input for two students, including their name, ID, and CGPA.

The program uses a **Student** class to store this information and evaluate the student's academic performance based on their CGPA.

### Features:
- Input student details (name, ID, and CGPA).
- Display student information.
- Evaluate academic performance based on CGPA.

### Check Result:
The `checkResult()` method returns:
- **"Good"** for CGPA above 3.50
- **"Better Luck Next Time"** otherwise

### Concepts Demonstrated:
- Basic Object-Oriented Concepts (Classes, Constructors, Methods)
- Using the `Scanner` class for user input
- Conditional statements (if-else)

### How It Works:
The program prompts the user to enter the details of two students, and based on the provided CGPA, it evaluates and displays whether the student performed well or needs to try again.
